# 📌 List of Talk Proposals

This page lists talk proposals. Do you have an idea you'd like to see talked about? This is the right place for it. Just submit a [pull reguest](https://github.com/lang-talk/meetups/pulls).

If you want to give a talk some time in the future you can also add the topic here.
Don't forget to mark it as `🔧 in the works` to make sure that others understand that you will take care of the talk.
This way you can create some traction for your talk before it is ready to be given.

If you'd want to propose a topic that someone else might pick up and make, mark it as `free to claim`.

The list:

- Making a Simple Automated Theorem Prover `🔧 in the works`
- Write Yourself a Prolog in 15 minutes `🔧 in the works`
- Write Yourself a CLP(FD) Solver `🔧 in the works`
- Introduction to Algebraic Effects and Handlers `🔧 in the works`
