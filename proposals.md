# 📌 List of Talk Proposals

This page lists talk proposals. Do you have an idea you'd like to see talked about? This is the right place!
Just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/lang-talk/meetups/pulls).

If you want to give a talk some time in the future you can also add the topic here.

There are three lists.

If you want to propose a talk that you'd like to give, put it inside the first one - titled `👷 Being Prepared`

If you want to propose a topic that you'd want anyone else to give, put it inside the second one - titled `🫳 Free to Claim`.

The last one is for proposals for talks that you'd like to give in the future, but they are currently not being worked on.
It is titled `🧊 Frozen`. You can mark the talk `🔧 in the works` if you still intend to give it, or you can mark it either
as `🫳 free to claim` if you are OK with other people claiming that topic, or as `🛠 open to collab` if you'll welcome a helping hand.


Additionaly, you can also mark the talk as `🛠 open to collab` - meaning that you will welcome other people approaching you with their ideas or requests - you can decide to give the talk together (ideally though, limit yourself to two or at most three speakers for obvious reasons).
